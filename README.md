# VEXGen

## What is VEXGen?

VEXGen is a simple generating tool of Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) and Threat Intelligence eXchange (TIX) files.

## Development requirements

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to deploy the tool.
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for container orchestration.
3. It is recommended to use a GUI such as [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/en/products/compass).
4. The Neo4J browser interface to visualize the graph built from the data is in [localhost:7474](http://0.0.0.0:7474/browser/) when the container is running.
5. Python 3.13 or higher.

## Deployment with docker

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository from the official GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/securechaindev/securechain-vexgen.git
cd securechain-vexgen
```

### 2. Configure environment variables
Create a `.env` file from the `template.env` file and place it in the `app/` directory.

#### Get API Keys

- How to get a *GitHub* [API key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

- Modify the **Json Web Token (JWT)** secret key and algorithm with your own. You can generate your own secret key with the command **openssl rand -base64 32**.

### 3. Create Docker network
Ensure you have the `securechain` Docker network created. If not, create it with:
```bash
docker network create securechain
```

### 4. Databases containers

For graphs and vulnerabilities information you need to download the zipped [data dumps]() from Zenodo. Once you have unzipped the dumps, inside the root folder run the command:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The containerized databases will also be seeded automatically.

### 5. Start the application
Run the command from the project root:
```bash
docker compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

### 6. Access the application
The API will be available at [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002). You can access the API documentation at [http://localhost:8002/docs](http://localhost:8002/docs). Also, in [http://localhost:8001/docs](http://localhost:8001/docs) you can access the auth API documetation.

## Python Environment
The project uses Python 3.13 and the dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Setting up the development environment

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3.13 -m venv vexgen-env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source vexgen-env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
